# Cold Steel Scouting Report

This report will evaluate and make recommendations about which Cold Steel products Connective Systems & Supply should stock.

## Description

Connective Systems & Supply is evaluating a new vendor, [Cold Steel Knife and Tool Company](https://www.coldsteel.com/), to determine which items CSS should stock from the vendor. While Cold Steel specializes in knives and edged tools generally, not all of its offerings are suitable for CSS to carry since many items do not have direct application in the construction industry. Assuming it is important to maintain the CSS brand as a construction industry supplier, I begin by identifying the Cold Steel products with the highest possibility of construction industry application. Once properly scoped, I assume that CSS would like to test the waters with a new vendor first and so would prefer to act conservatively by stocking only those items that are likely to sell and likely to make a profit. Accordingly, I recommend stocking only profitable items from the top 20 best selling construction industry items from Cold Steel.
